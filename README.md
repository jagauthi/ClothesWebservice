Java Webservices

To start: 

In order to get this to run, just go in command line to the project folder
and run "mvnw spring-boot:run". That will start up the webserver on localhost.
Then you can go to "http://localhost:8080/healthCheck".

Another option is go to the project folder and run "mvnw clean package". Then if you go to the target folder, there will be something called ClothesWebservice-0.1.jar   You can run that, and it will do the same as if you ran
"mvnw spring-boot:run", then you can hit the url previously given.
